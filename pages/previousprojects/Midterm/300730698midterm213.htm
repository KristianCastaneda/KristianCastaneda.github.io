				Red Hot Chili Peppers (also commonly known as the "Chili Peppers" or abbreviated as RHCP) 
				are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily 
				consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk 
				rock and psychedelic rock. When played live, they incorporate many aspects of jam band due to 
				the improvised nature of much of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding 
				members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael "Flea" Balzary (bass), longtime drummer Chad Smith,
				and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, who joined in late 2009, following the departure of John Frusciante. 
				Red Hot Chili Peppers have won seven Grammy Awards, and sold over 80 million records worldwide.[2] 
				The Red Hot Chili Peppers came in at # 30 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The Chili 
				Peppers ranked # 72 on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists, as well as placing # 128 on the Top Pop Artists 
				of the Past 25 Years chart. In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
				The band's original line-up featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea.
				Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's debut album, 
				The Red Hot Chili Peppers (1984). Cliff Martinez was the drummer for the first two records 
				(Irons played on the third), and guitarist Jack Sherman played on the first. Slovak performed on 
				two albums with the band (the second and third), Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987);
			    he died of a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of the death of his friend, drummer Irons chose to depart 
			    from the group. Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist DeWayne McKnight was brought in to replace Slovak though his 
			    tenure was short and he was replaced by John Frusciante in 1988. Former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H. Peligro was 
			    brought in to replace Irons though after a short tenure with the band he was out and replaced by Chad Smith that 
			    same year. The line-up of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante and Smith was the longest-lasting, and recorded five studio
			    albums starting with 1989's Mother's Milk. In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded 
			    under producer Rick Rubin the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which became the band's first commercial 
			    success. Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the success of the band and left abruptly in 1992, in the 
			    middle of the album tour.
