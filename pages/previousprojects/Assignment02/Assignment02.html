        <h3>Environmental Movement</h3>
        <p>
            The environmental movement, a term that includes conservation and green
            politics, is a diverse scientific, social, and political movement for addressing <br />
            environmental issues. Environmentalists advocate the sustainable management of
            resources and stewardship of the environment through changes in public policy <br />
            and individual behavior. In its recognition of humanity as a participant in (not
            enemy of) ecosystems, the movement is centered on ecology, health, and human
            rights.

                Yes, it is an oft-repeated statement, but its relevance never recedes. Lots of fossil <br />
                fuels are burned to generate electricity; the more we use, the more we burn, he more we <br />
                pollute the environment. A mere act of switching off the lights and electrical appliances <br />
                when not required can save huge amounts of energy. Many people these days construct their <br />
                houses and office in a way that more and more daylight can be used instead of using light bulbs.

        <center>
            <p>
                If you can get online it’s the best way to accessyour daily dose of news instead of <br />
                flipping through the thick pile of your regular newspapers. Millions of trees are cut <br />
                to supply papers; you can make a dint into this indiscriminate felling of trees by <br />
                discontinuing your printed subscription and switching to online subscription.

        <center>
            <p>
                We all know about the current fuel crisis and this crisis is caused by an ever-increasing <br />
                number of gas-guzzling automobiles being acquired by millions of people. To make matters <br />
                worse even food crops are being used to produce biofuels so that people can drive their cars. <br />
                Why not use the public transport; it’s not only cheaper, it’s also healthier and environment <br />
                friendly because first,you’ll have to walk a distance to use the public transport and second, <br />
                lesser vehicles will be on the road. In fact this will also reduce the frequency of traffic jams.

        <center>
            <p>
                This is particularly true with the plastic products that you use. Once you throw them <br />
                away they become a part of a huge pile of non-biodegradable garbage our planet is rapidly <br />
                accumulating. First of all you should discourage the use of plastics in your day-to-day life <br />
                but even if it is unavoidable try to recycle as many plasticbr products as you can so <br />
                that fewer replacements are produced and fewer plastic objects are dumped on earth.

                Politicians, fortunately or unfortunately enjoy/wield great powers and they can usher big <br />
                changes if they have the intention. Make a cleaner environment a political issue and vote <br />
                for only those politicians that show sensitivity towards climate and environment. If you <br />
                do some research online you will discover, to your shock, how politicians stall proactive <br />
                environmental-friendly legislations and policies due to personal greed and business affiliations.

            <p>
                Let the companies and organizations that wreak havoc with your environment go out of business; <br />
                stop using their products. Some individuals and organizations comprehend the gravity of the <br />
                situation only when you hit below the belt, and in this case, it is the money that you snatch<br />
                out of their hands by refusing to do business with them.

            <p>
                Someday your children will grow up and inherit the planet and then their children will grow up<br />
                and inherit the planet from them. Make a beginning and start sensitizing and educating your<br />
                children so that they can handover a healthier planet to their children. Teach them how to<br />
                conserve power and not to exploit the natural resources of our planet. Tell them how important<br />
                it is to preserve the flora and fauna. Also make them aware from the beginning itself what a <br />
                catastrophe can be unleashed upon earth if we don’t take care of our surroundings.
